How much does it cost
To live the life of your dreams
And how long will I
Keep wondering how I could be

At what cost?
There is a price
And it may not be nice

(Kill you) Where's your smiling face
(Kill you) Say hello to a world of disgrace
(Kill you) How long will I wait
For the best revenge

I am
I am
I am

So how much did you lose
To live the life of your dreams
And how does it feel
To absolutely be so complete

At what cost?
There is a price
And it may not be nice

(Kill you) Where is your smiling face
(Kill you) Say hello to a world of disgrace
(Kill you) How long will I wait
For the best revenge

Oh they got all the answers
Oh they got all the answers
Oh they got all the answers
Oh they got all the answers

Kill you
Best revenge
For the best revenge

(Kill you) With that smiling face
(Kill you) Say hello to a world of disgrace
(Kill you) How long will I wait
For the best revenge!

(Kill you) Living well (I am)
(Kill you) Living well (I am)
(Kill you) Living well
For the best revenge

I am
I am
I am

At what cost?
There is a price
And it may not be nice

At what cost?
There is a price
And it may not be nice
