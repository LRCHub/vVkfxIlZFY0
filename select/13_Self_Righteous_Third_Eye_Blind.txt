Kimya Dawson: Come on, take a dare.
Stephan Jenkins: No. *KD laughs* See, it's working. I told you this would work.
KD: You're never going to find any peace. You're like a haunted house at midnight (?). Come on.

Everyone is so self-righteous
Lift your head again and try this

If you want this, I do
And I want this, but I can't break through
And I can see you begin to glow

Everyone is so self-righteous
Get up everyone now
We're all on our own now
Lift your head again try this

And feel you, I do
And I want this, but I can't break through
And your burning lights red and blue
Everyone is so self-righteous

Where have you sinners gone?
All you sinners

What's ours is ours
And we're all alone
(Where have you sinners gone?)
What's ours is ours
And outside rain
(Where have you sinners gone?)
It's just a shower
(All of you sinners)
And then I feel you breathe
(Where have you sinners gone?)
And I let go the hours
(All of you sinners)
And I feel your skin
(Where have you sinners gone?)
And I let you in
(All you sinners)
And that's my dream
(Where have you sinners gone?)
Again and again
I feel the hours
Sliding by
(Everyone is so self-righteous)

Get up on your own, now
Way up all alone (?), now
Lift your head again and try this

Do you want this, in you
You're the only thing that's real
And we don't need to beg or steal

SJ: I actually like that thing that the idea that what you're wearing is worn by somebody who's probably been dead for a hundred years.
KD: Alright. *Laughs*
