They'd probably give their whole success away
If that would buy us just one easy day
But we'll keep breaking any helpful tie
On our old sleep-deprivation high
And tell our old lie

And yeah, yeah, where's Julie?
I've got a feeling that she's far away
I've got a feeling she was never really dumb enough to stay
