Go go go go go

Well I can see the sun
I got the minerals
It's fucking righteous baby

I got the stellar tights
A ballerina's type
It's fucking righteous baby, baby

Well I can see the sun
I got those minerals
It's fucking righteous baby

We got the jackets flat
You got to sit in back
It's fucking righteous baby, baby

Well I can see the sun
I got the minerals
It's fucking righteous baby
Fucking righteous baby, baby

I can see the sun
Got the minerals
It's fucking righteous baby, baby

Two one two
Three three three
Two two oh six
